## Development goals

This is a side project to try out a bunch of technologies & methodologies. I can't say much about it just yet, but it's going to a SPA webapp. While I do want to build a functioning product for the public, I also want to use this as a playground to learn & grow as a developer. In addition to this, I want to have this repo public to hold myself accountable to build a project to completion.

I want to follow a strong Test Driven & Storybook driven approach with development, and use git-flow workflow for version control.

**planned technologies**

- Firebase for hosting + realtime db
- React for UI
- React-Router for client side router
- Redux for state management
- Parcel for bundling
- Styled Components for styling
- Styled-grid for a grid
- Jest + enzyme for testing
- storybook
- Flow for static analysis
- Flamelink for CMS
- Travis for CI/CD
